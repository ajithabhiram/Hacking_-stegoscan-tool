steganography vulnerablity scanner

The technique of hiding data in digital media through Steganography operates as a vital platform for safe communication among networks. The identical tool serves security functions but raises substantial risks when used illegally for tasks like hidden communication and data removal or malicious software distribution. The proposed system serves as a Steganography Vulnerabilities Scanner to detect hiding data in media files by implementing rule-based analysis methods. The system departs from contemporary methods by using min imalistic statistical and structural analysis approaches which incorporate entropy analysis combined with chi-square attack and histogram inspection and bit-plane analysis. This applica tion provides universal file type support through its scanning capabilities which include images and audio and video formats and it enables operation through both command-line mode and optional graphical user interface. The proposed system delivers both effective and accessible anomaly detection at low operational cost which makes it appropriate for various resource-limited deployment scenarios.

HOW TO USE THIS: 1.download the zip file 2.extract the files 3.use vs code , install the required libraries 4.run the code file named app.py 5.it will provide you local host server link 6.click on the link and the tool will be ready to use

HOW TO TEST THIS TOOL: there are many online tools availablle fo hidding the info in image, audio, video *first upload an normal file without any content hidden in it *then use any online tools to embedd the content in files and test it

tools i have used to hide the content *for image :- manytools steganography *for audio:- deepsound
